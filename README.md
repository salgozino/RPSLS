# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

This is a basic front end created with Vite + Rainbowkit + wagmi to play the Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Game.

To create a game, the user will be deploying the RSP contract that can be found in [clesaege github](https://github.com/clesaege/RPS/blob/master/RPS.sol). A copy of the Smart Contract can be found in the "contracts" folder.
To use this game, the user has to connect his wallet to goerli network. If you can test the frontend in another EVM compatible chains, must be configured in wagmi lib file.
